</h1>

## What is this for?
This repository give you information about akbar and if you ask any questions about Akbar than it is able to give you answer. 

## Transformers
[Transformer](https://pypi.org/project/transformers/) models can also perform tasks on several modalities combined, such as table question answering, optical character recognition, information extraction from scanned documents, video classification, and visual question answering.

To immediately use a model on a given input (text, image, audio, ...), we provide the pipeline API. Pipelines group together a pretrained model with the preprocessing that was used during that model's training. Here is how to quickly use a pipeline to classify positive versus negative texts:

## Ngrok
[Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs) allows you to expose a web server running on your local machine to the internet. Just tell ngrok what port your web server is listening on.


## Installation
```pip install flask-ngrok```

```pip install pyngrok```

```pip install -U flask-cors```

```pip install flask-ngrok```

```! pip install transformers```

## Instruction
First, set up this repository on your local machine or colab.
Installing all dependency in your local machine or colab.
and, authentication you ngrok token. 
 
To run 
run all the jupiter or colab cell

To make changes
at line 5 on ```ngrok authtoken "<_YOUR_NGROK_TOKEN_>"``` this is your ngrok token.

To access the API.<br>
